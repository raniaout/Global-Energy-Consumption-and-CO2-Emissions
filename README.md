# Global Energy Consumption and CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Analysis

## üìò Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my final data analyst training. It explores global patterns in energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions using a public dataset "Statistical Review of World Energy 2022". The goal was to identify trends, compare regions and countries, and support sustainability insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
- Python (Pandas for data cleaning and preparation)
- Power BI (for analysis and visualisation)


## üìà Key Insights
- Global energy consumption and CO‚ÇÇ emissions continue to rise, showing that fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix despite ongoing transition efforts.
- Asia Pacific leads global energy demand growth, driven by industrial expansion, while North America and Europe remain major consumers but with slower growth.
- China and the U.S . are the top energy consumers and emitters , but countries like Qatar, Singapore, and Iceland lead in per capita energy use.
- Renewable energy use is increasing , but it is not growing fast enough to displace fossil fuels or reduce total emissions.
- Emission intensity (CO‚ÇÇ per unit of energy) is slowly improving , but overall emissions continue to rise, indicating insufficient decarbonization.
- Sustainability remains a global challenge: clean energy growth is encouraging, but rising energy demand outpaces progress in efficiency and emission reduction.
