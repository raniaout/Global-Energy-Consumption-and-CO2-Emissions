# Global Energy Consumption and CO₂ Emissions Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my final data analyst training. It explores global patterns in energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions using a public dataset "Statistical Review of World Energy 2022". The goal was to identify trends, compare regions and countries, and support sustainability insights.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas for data cleaning and preparation)
- Power BI (for analysis and visualisation)

## 📂 Project Files
- `notebook/analysis.ipynb`: Python notebook for data cleaning and analysis
- `dashboard/final_report.pbix`: Power BI report file
- `dashboard/screenshots/`: Images of the Power BI dashboard

## 📈 Key Insights
- Fossil fuels still dominate global energy use
- Renewable energy is growing faster in Europe and North America
- CO₂ emissions per capita vary greatly by region
