# Global Energy Consumption and CO₂ Emissions Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my final data analyst training. It explores global patterns in energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions using a public dataset "Statistical Review of World Energy 2022". The goal was to identify trends, compare regions and countries, and support sustainability insights.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas for data cleaning and preparation)
- Power BI (for analysis and visualisation)

## 📂 Project Files
- `notebook/analysis.ipynb`: Python notebook for data cleaning and analysis
- `dashboard/final_report.pbix`: Power BI report file
- `dashboard/screenshots/`: Images of the Power BI dashboard

## 📈 Key Insights
- Global energy consumption and CO₂ emissions continue to rise, showing that fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix despite ongoing transition efforts.
- Asia Pacific leads global energy demand growth, driven by industrial expansion, while North America and Europe remain major consumers but with slower growth.
- China and the U.S . are the top energy consumers and emitters , but countries like Qatar, Singapore, and Iceland lead in per capita energy use.
- Renewable energy use is increasing , but it is not growing fast enough to displace fossil fuels or reduce total emissions.
- Emission intensity (CO₂ per unit of energy) is slowly improving , but overall emissions continue to rise, indicating insufficient decarbonization.
- Sustainability remains a global challenge: clean energy growth is encouraging, but rising energy demand outpaces progress in efficiency and emission reduction.
